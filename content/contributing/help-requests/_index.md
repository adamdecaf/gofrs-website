The Gofrs organization exists to help strengthen the Go ecosystem through the
maintenance of critical packages, and the inception of new solutions to
problems that arise as our community grows.

If you found a project you feel would be a good fit for us to maintain, or a
problem you think we're uniquely equipped to address, we're currently using
GitHub issues to track these requests (and the subsequent discussions). 

The GitHub issues have a template of information to fill-out, which is used to
help us initially gauge whether the project would be a good fit for us. After
the issue is filed, someone from the Gofrs will review the help request and
start the appropriate conversation.

You can file a GitHub issue
[here](https://github.com/gofrs/help-requests/issues/new).
