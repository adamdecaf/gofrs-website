The biggest way that we can be successful at meeting our goals, is to make it as
easy as possible for people in the community to contribute. This means doing our
best to allow people to easily join our organization, and to help them be
successful.

### [Requesting our Help](./help-requests/)
Do you have a project you think would be a good fit to help us maintain? This
could be a project you're currently the maintainer of, or one that you rely on
personally. Is there a problem the Go community is facing that you feel might be
good to put our group effort behind? If so, you can file a help request.

### [Joining our Organization](./join-requests/)
If you'd like to help triage issues, to help maintain a package you think we
should maintain, or to have a say in the direction we take as a group, you can
join our organization. This process is fairly light.
