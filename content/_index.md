The Gofrs is a community-formed group working together to better the entire Go
ecosystem. Some of these efforts include picking up the maintenance of projects
that are widely used or have large impact, as well as to consider new solutions
to problems that arise as the number of Go programmers continues to grow.

We initially formed in the summer of 2018 to take one of the most popular UUID

to [look at contributing to more projects](https://github.com/gofrs/help-requests/issues).

We'll be adding more content soon, and here is a list of the current top-level
